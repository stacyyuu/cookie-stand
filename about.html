      <h1>One Big Dream</h1>
      <p>It all started with one big dream and the perfect combination of flour, sugar, and a hint of salmon. Salmon Cookies was founded by Pat Abe. The crazy idea started after Pat was in the process of making cookies and accidentally dropped in some salmon seasoning. He figured he might as well try the end result since he had already gotten that far... To his surpise, it was a delicious creation! He gathered feedback and tested recipes — a practice that is still part of the Salmon Cookies process — until he created the world's first and best salmon cookie.</p>

      <h1>First Store</h1>
      <p>After developing the perfect recipe, Pat created the first store in Seattle, Washington in 2021. From day one, it was important to him that Salmon Cookies customers see their cookies being mixed, balled, baked and dressed in real-time. Equally as important were the high-quality ingredients used in each unique batch. At first, Salmon Cookies only served for takeout and delivery, but other services slowly began being offered such as curbside pick-up, catering, nationwide shipping and more! Now Salmon Cookies can be found international. Check out our contact page for more locations!</p>
